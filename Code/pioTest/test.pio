.program test
; input data totaling 32 bytes - 16 for each channel and the program should work
; let side 0 be the wsel, side 1 be the clock/bck
.side_set 2
; need to set channel, then one bit of data, then bck, then repeat
; low means begin reading a bit
; I believe the wsel determines the size of the data in and must be used
; example code from pico-extras says it needs autopull, not sure why
; should note that this code is basically the same as the pico-extras - it's pretty optimized already, using all side sets available for each instruction. The only change is the label, which specify which channel is being used instead of a vague "bitloop0"

; set the wsel to left channel, need to be set one cycle before data
; value set to 14 because first out is not counted and last out is not counted
set x, 14 side 0b11
; loop:
loopLeft:
    ; needs to happen 16 times - corresponding to data in size
    out pins, 1 side 0b10
    jmp x-- loopLeft 0b11
    ; set the wsel to left channel, then send last bit
    out pins, 1 side 0b00
    set x, 14 side 0b01
loopRight:
    ; needs to happen 16 times - corresponding to data in size
    out pins, 1 side 0b00
    ; set the wsel to right channel, then send last bit
    jmp x--, loopRight side 0b01
    out pins, 1 side 0b10
    ; is a loop required for i2s or is it handled outside, in C?
        ; if it's outside, the clock speed must be set or else there will either be a quick pulse of sound or a square wave like shape when the device is waiting
    ; jmp loop

; out_shift, second parameter sets shift direction (msb first)
; also the clock pin can be set to an arbitrary gp pin by adding a parameter and using it as the sideset_pins base
; if the clock is causing problems, use sm_config_set_clkdiv(&c, <value>)
    ; problems could be caused by excessive waiting, as mentioned before and making sure that the clock is evenly distributed in terms of time should resolve the problems
    ; note that the example code doesn't configure the clock in the pio portion and instead configures it outside, in C
    ; it seems to allow dynamic audio frequencies that way
